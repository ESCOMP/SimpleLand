module CLMFatesInterfaceMod
   
   ! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ! This module contains various functions and definitions to aid in the
   ! coupling of the FATES library/API with the CLM/ALM/ATS/etc model driver.  
   ! All connections between the two models should occur in this file alone.  
   ! 
   ! This is also the only location where CLM code is allowed to see FATES memory 
   ! structures.
   ! The routines here, that call FATES library routines, will not pass any types defined
   ! by the driving land model (HLM).
   ! 
   ! either native type arrays (int,real,log, etc) or packed into fates boundary condition
   ! structures.
   !
   ! Note that CLM/ALM does use Shared Memory Parallelism (SMP), where processes such as 
   ! the update of state variables are forked.  However, IO is not assumed to be 
   ! threadsafe and therefore memory spaces reserved for IO must be continuous vectors,
   ! and moreover they must be pushed/pulled from history IO for each individual 
   ! bounds_proc memory space as a unit.
   !
   ! Therefore, the state variables in the clm_fates communicator is vectorized by
   ! threadcount, and the IO communication arrays are not.
   !
   !
   ! Conventions:
   ! keep line widths within 90 spaces
   ! HLM acronym = Host Land Model
